  <div class="words"><p>Hello! My name is Jazmin Eubanks and I am a software development apprentice. </p>
<p>My passion for tech sprouted when I previously worked at Verizon. I went to work every day excited to be surrounded by all the new emerging technology such as the launch of 5G. After working at Verizon, I tried to follow a more traditional career path and obtained my claims adjuster license. After being a claims adjuster in auto and commercial property for about 4 years, I felt myself missing the tech industry and wanting more growth opportunities in my career.</p>
<p></p>So, I dusted off my computer and got back into learning to code. This is what lead me to my journey at Discovery Partners Institute.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I am a mom of two boys, ages two and four. I study herbalism and love all things related to health and wellness. I firmly believe that to thrive at work, one must take care of themself mentally, physically, and emotionally. I also have a passion for reading and writing, and one day I  hope to accomplish my side project of writing a book.</p>
